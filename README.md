<h1>logistic_regression</h1>
<p>This is a logistic regression algorithm in machine learning used for yes or no predictions. The machine learning algorithm is built with Numpy from the scratch with mathematical equations rather than using an external module like Scikit-learn. To increase the performance and accuracy of the algorithm, feature scaling (Z-score normalization) and regularization technniques are used. It makes predictions with the final model and visualizes various graphs like decision curve, sigmoid curve and training data.</p>
