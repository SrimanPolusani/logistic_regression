<h1>logistic_regression</h1>
<p>This is a logistic regression algorithm in machine learning used for yes or no predictions. The machine learning algorithm is built with Numpy from the scratch with mathematical equations rather than using an external module like Scikit-learn. The object 'LogisticRegression' has methods for finding cost, computing gradient and performing gradient descent. It can make predictions with the final model and vizualize various graphs like decision curve, sigmoid curve and training data.</p>
